MToolkit
========

MToolkit is a simple PHP toolkit.
It borns from a requirement: develop a website quickly and powerfully.
I know, someone can say "Use Zend Framwork, CakePHP!", but I could answer: "They are very good toolkits, but they aren't the toolkit that I want!" :P

The experiences with other toolkit in different platforms have led to create this toolkit.
MToolkit borns like a mash-up of two frameworks: .NET and Qt. o_O
Yes, the framework of the evil and the desktop framework for excellence.
